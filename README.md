# Portfolio-Constructor-and-Optimizer
A program that created an optimized portfolio using Monte Carlo Simulations and Sequential Least Squares Programming

Scatter plot generated from Monte Carlo Simulation
Pie Charge generated from optimized Portfolio via Sequential Least Squares Programming
Text generated with the desired mix and the stats of that mix

First: 
	Enter the number of stocks you want in your portfolio
Second: 
	Enter their tickers
Third:
	Press 1 if you have a desired return for you Portfolio or 2 if you want the optimal portfolios for any given return
	IF you pressed 1:
		now provide the return you desire

Variables you can change within the code:
	Starting Date:
		Within the function that pulls historical data for stocks, you can change the start date (the date that
		from which collection concerning the returns begins)

Warning:
	The in-built function, that pulls data from yahoo, randomly malfunctions
	I have built in a loop that will try and run it 6 times
	If it still fails try running the program another 1-2 times
